Description: Replace the standard x-axis in 'ggplots' with a combination matrix
  to visualize complex set overlaps. UpSet has introduced a new way to visualize
  the overlap of sets, this package provides a simple way to produce such plots
  using ggplot. In addition it can convert any categorical axis into a combination
  matrix axis.
